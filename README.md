 - *rule-lists-python-package* - contains the python package the powers all the experiments, which at (https://github.com/HMProenca/RuleList)
 - *chapter-4-predictive-rule-lists-experiments* - contains all the experiments relating to chapter 4 (predictive rules lists) of the dissertation, also at (https://github.com/HMProenca/MDLRuleLists)
 - *chapter-5-subgroup-lists-experiments* - contains all the experiments relating to chapter 5 (subgroup lists) of the dissertation, also at (https://github.com/HMProenca/RobustSubgroupDiscovery)
 - *robust-rules-for-prediction-and-description.pdf* - contains an early version of the PhD dissertation.
